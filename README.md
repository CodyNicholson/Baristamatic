In this project I programed a command-line application for ordering coffee from a coffee machine. Upon running the application the user will be greeted with a menu and the current inventory of ingredients that the coffee machine has available. The user can order drinks which will consume ingredients. The menu will tell the user which drinks can be made with the current inventory of ingredients, and which cannot be made.

Order a drink by entering the number for the drink you want. Enter 'q' to quit, and 'r' to restock the coffee machine with ingredients.
